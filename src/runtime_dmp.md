# DMP

The downward message passing (DMP) will be responsible for managing messages
passed by the L2 relay chain to the L3.  This will need to define the
permissions of the relay chain, this will be of particular relevance in regards
to upgrades signaled by the L2.  In addition the L2 will pass the state roots
/ message queue roots of the other L3's on the platform.  These state roots
will form the basis of secure cross L3 rollup communication.
