# Fractal Overview

Fractal is a platform that solves the scalability problem by providing
cryptographically verifiable sharded execution powered by zero-knowledge
technology. The architecture consists of a cryptographically verifiable layer
2 (L2) relay chain upon which cryptographically verifiable layer 3 (L3)
execution environments can be deployed effortlessly and permissionlessly. The
L3â€™s have instant access to liquidity, users, a network of decentralised
provers and are interoperable via secure cross-L3 messaging. The L3 execution
environments will utilise a standardised runtime providing a zero-knowledge
virtual machine with solidity support and a Web3 API such that developers can
work with familiar tooling. The environment operator has the option to define
access control lists specifying who is allowed to deploy and interact with
contracts in the environment. The execution environment runtime will be
developed by the core platform team to add new features. The team will take
direction and guidance from the community and L3 operators. The platform will
support fork-less on-chain runtime upgrades which are managed by on-chain
governance on L2 and will be pushed to L3 upon approval. The platform can
support over 100 L3 execution environments. The environments can be
application, ecosystem, industry or enterprise specific. These isolated and
secure execution environments will allow for new use cases to be realised.
The platform architecture can be seen in Figure 1.
