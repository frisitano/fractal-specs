# Fractal Specification

This book will be used as a versioned specification for the Fractal platform.  Information
relating to components, data structures, and implementation details will be 
accumulated in this book.  This will allow new members of the team to use this book
as a source of truth for the vision and low level details of the platform and therefore
get up to speed quickly.
